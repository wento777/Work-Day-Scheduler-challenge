Challenge# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# WORK DAY SCHEDULER CHALLENGE

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 5 Challenge.

- The purpose of this challenge was to build a work day scheduler, using our knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We need to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. After that to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

- For this challenge we needed to clone the starter code repository and make our own repository with the starter code.

- The starter code uses the Day.js Links to an external site.library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient. 


 This project has been deployed to GitHub. 
 
 - To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.


  Here is a link to the deployed application: 


## Prerequisites

## Summary

- Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
- The starter code uses the Day.js Links to an external site.library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.
- This project emphasizes the use of using Javascript to make dynamic changes to an HMTL document.
- This project utilizes the use of appending HTML pages.




## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
